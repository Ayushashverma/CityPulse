					<div class="article">
						<p>Thus reads a small hoarding in front of one of the city’s
							most famous paan shops in the busy market of Hazratganj. Indeed,
							there is reason enough to smile! When one Lucknowite’s mind was
							dissected and cut opened in two, these were the five things that
							were found stuffed inside, the tentacles ever galloping for more.
							This article talks about the psychology that drives the city of
							Lucknow.</p>
						<p>
							<h2>Pride and no prejudice:</h2>
						</p>
						<p>What is pumped into the blood of this city of astonishment
							is the rich, unyielding sense of pride. That of crediting one’s
							birth to a place of epitomized cultural distinguishment, and the
							cognizance of a place so celebrated that one feels the terrible
							urge to brag about. This is just one of the many myriad powers of
							the city.</p>
						<p>We cannot call Lucknow a cross-cultural junction. This is
							because Lucknow has emerged powerful enough to defy the extremist
							laws of the prevailing communities, so as to give it the name of
							a “junction”. It is the thick layer between contrasting
							identities with a peculiar culture of its own, which has evolved
							as the quintessence. Now, Lucknow is seen by the world by this
							mixed culture, which incorporates both the Hindu and the Muslim
							lifestyles.</p>
						<p>
							<h2>Ethnically modern:</h2>
						</p>
						<p>Lucknow boasts of a victory among revolting genres in more
							than one form. Here, opulence lies in traditionalism. Wealth lies
							in richness in culture. This is the land of culture and variety,
							and perfect splendor is when after the World Cup, with faces
							painted in the tricolors, you travel to and block the Hazratganj
							road at midnight, and dance amidst the confusion of a hundred
							criss-crossing enthusiasts exactly like you. When after stuffing
							yourself full in plush hotels, you turn your car to Azhar
							paanwala and come home happy. It is in the little details that
							complete the process of perfection, the details that cannot be
							sought anywhere else.</p>
						<p>
							<h2>Nawabs with kebabs:</h2>
						</p>
						One cannot go to Lucknow and miss the exotic kebabs which melt at
						once when placed on the tongue, like butter, yet sustains the
						subtle savor for quite long. Established in 1862, the Tunday
						Kababi has a respectable past of 152 years of glory. Defeating the
						efficacy of all the large 5-star hotels, it wins the ‘clean sweep’
						among food hubs, much like the Modi-sweep in the recent General
						Elections. The Tunday business, in all its years, has never seen a
						downfall.
						</p>
						<p>There is a fine thread which subtly binds the two cultures
							into tight knots, and this is food. The Hindus enjoy beef kebabs
							as much as the Muslims. Ravdis are popular among all groups, and
							nobody can talk about Lucknow and not mention its famous Dashheri
							Aam, especially from the thriving village of Maliyabad.</p>
						<p>Therefore, food shows no discrimination. It is not subject
							to converging mindsets or communalism either. Food is just the
							essential tadka on the already prepared dish.</p>
						<p>
							<h2>Mind your Tehzeeb:</h2>
						</p>
						<p>With opposite communities residing in one area, a bilingual
							culture is the most common guess. However, Lucknow never fails to
							surprise us. The cultural Capital of North India has come up with
							an intricate euphemism of the opposite prevailing cultures – a
							blend, which in its attempt to encompass elements from both Hindi
							and Urdu, ended up mixing up both with a high form of accent,
							called Ganga-Jamuna tehzeeb. It is a characteristic way of
							speech, generally symptomatic of a great deal of respect to the
							listener.</p>
						<p>
							<h2>Diplomacy in the name of politics:</h2>
						</p>
						<p>Lucknow is a picture of a beaming culture within a strong
							political framework. The two layers have strong identities of
							their own, but how these meet is interesting. The juncture is
							marked by a melting effect – both melt when in contact with each
							other. This is due to the heat of diplomacy. The leaders have
							huge sugar-coated promises to give, but what is presented in the
							name of ‘development’ is self- adulation and competitive
							narcissism. We see a Lohia park coming up, in the quest of this
							kind of competition. Then, we have a renovated Ambedkar Park.
							Later, the Hazratganj area is renovated to match the eliteness of
							Cannaught Plae, Delhi, and others like it. Such developments are
							still in progress, because there is no one to check, no one to
							question. The citizens seem contended with the pretence of
							lavishness around them. The check on buck-flow or addressing
							important, evident issues like poverty or illiteracy are out of
							the question anyway.</p>
						<p>This city has the might to astonish us beyond
							comprehension, and then pull us back into the darkness of
							politics. Being one of the major centres of political powers in
							India, it never fails to make its presence marked. This city can
							enchant, shock and perplex at the same time. The psychology of a
							Lucknowite, thus, is that of the proud and the blind.</p>
